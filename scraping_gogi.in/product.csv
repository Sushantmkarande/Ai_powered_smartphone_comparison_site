Check this Realme U1 review to know how the handset is, can it play PUBG game and is it a better option compared with the Redmi Note 6 Pro? ,Buy from Amazon – ,Realme U1 unboxing – ,
Redmi Note 6 Pro review – ,Realme U1 looks great, premium, however the glass type back after a long period of time will attract scratches and the handset after few months will not look that premium. Hence makes sense to use a silicon case or any other case to protect the handset right from the day you are using it.,Realme U1 is using MediaTek Helio P70 octa core chipset that does a really good job, especially when you play PUBG game you are going to enjoy the overall gaming experience. This handset features a 6.3 inch screen with duedrop notch that looks pretty good.,Do check the Realme U1 review video, in that video I have also done a brief comparison of the Realme U1 vs Redmi Note 6 Pro, do check the camera samples too.,In general the Realme U1 is more powerful but when it comes to camera and battery life then the Redmi Note 6 Pro does a better job.,The 3500 mAh battery on a full charge will give you one to one and a half days of battery life. There is no LED notification, sound is loud and clear. I got antutu score of around 1,43,000.

So all depends on your usage and which parameter you want to give more weightage, accordingly you can either go with U1 or the Note 6 Pro."

Realme C1,Realme C1 review – really में best budget friendly smartphone,4.2,"With ,, the company also launched the Realme C1 smartphone that not only comes with impressive specifications but also carries an impressive price tag. Here is the review of Realme C1, it really is the best budget friendly smartphone for the price of just Rs. 6,999. ,The Realme C1 comes with triple SIM slots and is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 octa core processor, good part is it does support dual VoLTE – check video review to see it in action. The C1 weighs about 168 grams and is 8.2mm thick.,It is running ColorOS 5.1 out of the box based on Android 8.1. There is 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM, plus micro SD card of up to 256GB is supported. Realme C1 does not come with finger print sensor but there is face unlock that does a really good job, very fast, almost instant.,Screen is 6.2 inches with 1520 x 720 pixels resolution (HD+), 19:9 aspect ratio, and yes display with notch and 2.5D curved glass. When it comes to sensor you also get gyro and magnetic sensors, along with other common sensors. There is built in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.,The Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset is well know, powerful and efficient. For general use the handset gives a good performance, but when it comes to gaming you will need to reduce the graphics quality.,Antutu score I got was – 73656,I even tested the Pubg game. Pubg game play was good enough, not really that smooth but playable. I guess the 2GB RAM does effect the performance on some app, specially the high end games, 3GB would have improved the performance, but for Rs. 6,999 can’t really complain.,On the rear there are dual cameras 13MP + 2MP and front camera is 5MP. Rear camera aperture is f/2.2 + f/2.4 and front camera aperture is f/2.2. You can shoot portrait mode using both front and rear camera. Do check the camera samples.,This handset can shoot FHD videos, there is no slow mo option but you can shoot time-lapse videos. Camera quality is above average. Day light bokeh shots / long shots are great but low light shots are not that impressive., , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Another impressive thing on the C1 is the 4230 mAh battery. They have given 5V/1A charger that took me about 4 hours 20 minutes for a full charge.

Apple iPhone XS,"iPhone XS review, PUBG GamePlay, Camera Samples and why it is not that costly",4.8,"The Apple iPhone XS and the XS Max is available in and here is the review of iPhone XS. In this review I have covered the handset performance, quality, played PUBG game, shared some camera samples and the battery performance. ,Apple iPhone XS is a really premium handset that comes with a really premium price tag, now many compare the iPhone with Android and everything comes down to the price. But if you think logically the iPhone is not that costly. A iPhone XS for example will not get outdated even after 2 years and the performance will be the same, but when it comes to Android smartphones, forget 2 years in every 6 month a new model or a new hardware is announced.,Having said that, iPhone are pricey but if you use it (and most iPhone users do) for over 2 years, in the long run it is not that costly, plus you do not feel like the handset is outdated – as a new iPhone is launched every year compared to a new Android phone being launched almost every month.,Apple makes its own hardware and its own software – the iOS. And they have really optimized the hardware and software, so well, that once you use an iPhone you will fall in love with its smooth performance. You do get smooth performance on Android too, but the difference is clearly noticeable (much, much better on Apple).,The iPhone XS is running iOS 12 out of the box. Screen quality is awesome and specially the 3D touch (can sense touch pressure) is pretty impressive. The typing experience on the iPhone XS was also a lot different much better, much smoother. One thing you will notice is that the iPhone responds instantly be it opening an app or saying Hey SIRI.,The handset feels premium to hold and use, really premium. Glass on the back does make it a bit slippery. I am comfortable with iPhone XS but if you need a bigger screen then there is the iPhone XS Max.,Screen is 5.8 inches, Super Retina HD display, OLED multi touch display with 2436 x 1125 pixels resolution and yes it does come with notch. Screen quality is really premium with 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio – viewable in any lighting condition.,The iPhone XS sides are stainless steel and weight is 177 grams. The new iPhone is IP68 certified that makes is splash, water and dust resistant.,Inside the hood there is Apple’s own A12 Bionic Chipset with next gen neural engine. This is hexa core CPU. On Android you can get octa core, but as mentioned Apple has full control on its hardware and software and when you use the handset you will know the difference.,Talking about Antutu score I got 301974.,I played PUBG game, in HDR / Ultra Graphics quality mode – really impressive. The game play was buttery smooth and best part is the instant response and the smoothness when taking aim. Indeed the best experience I had when playing PUBG.,Handset hardly heats up.,iOS 12 is more secure than the Android and if you have been a Android user it will be a little weird getting simple things done like transferring files, movies, music from PC to iPhone XS.,There is no finger print sensor but there is Face ID (face unlock) and it works great. When registering for Face ID it takes over 1 minutes or so, as it records every angle of your face.,This handset comes with a nano SIM slot and there is a eSIM. This eSIM is integrated SIM but for now it is not enabled in India, the company will roll out an update soon to enable iPhone XS eSIM for Indian users. Also note that for now only Reliance Jio and Airtel offers eSIM support.,On the rear there 12MP dual cameras a wide angle and a telephoto lens with f/1.8 and f/2.4 aperture respectively. You get 2x ZOOM. There is dual optical image stabilization and you can shoot smooth videos in 1080p resolution.,The iPhone XS can shoot 4K videos at 60fps with stereo sound recording. There is also time lapse video with stabilization, plus you can shoot slow motion in 1080p at 240 fps. You can check the samples in the video review.,Still shots are pretty impressive, really good edge detection and natural blurring (bokeh) effects. There are couple of lighting effects that you can select before or after the image is captured. The 7MP front camera can also capture perfect selfies with bokeh mode.,When you shoot in bokeh mode after the image is captured you can control the depth. Animoji and Memoji also supported.,Overall iPhone XS image quality is excellent. Low light shots are great but there are premium smartphones out there that can shoot better in low light., , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,The iPhone XS comes with 2658 mAh battery that may look too low if you are thinking from the Android perspective but, but, but, this battery capacity is more than enough. I easily got over a day of mixed usage.,The charger provided is normal charger but the iPhone XS supports fast charging and wireless charging. With normal charger provided in the box it takes about 2 hours 30 minutes to charge but with fast charger, charging is much faster about half the time.,I am getting an easy over a day of battery life better than when compared with my Galaxy S9 Plus.,iPhone is different, makes no sense comparing with the Android phones. Also in terms of price the iPhone looks really costly but as mentioned you will be using it for 2 to 3 years easily as the iPhone XS will not get outdated for another 2 to 3 years.,An excellent buy if you are looking for a completely different user experience and if you have the money to spend initially. You can either go with the iPhone XS or the XS Max.,You can buy the iPhone XS / XS Max from – "
GoPro Hero 7 Black,"GoPro Hero 7 Black review (in Hindi) – with built in HyperSmooth stabilization, better than a gimbal!",4.8,"Here is GoPro Hero 7 Black review, in this video I have done the GoPro Hero 7 Black unboxing, talked about the features and also shared some samples shot using the GoPro Hero 7 Black action camera. ,You can buy the GoPro Hero 7 Black from Amazon for Rs. 36,999 – ,Inside the box you will get the camera, user manual, mount accessories, USB to USB Type C cable and 1220 mAh removable, rechargeable battery. This GoPro Hero 7 can shoot in 4K resolution at 60 FPS that too with HyperSmooth stabilization.,The unique thing about the GoPro Hero 7 Black is the built in HyperSmooth Stabilization. Once you open the box pack and switch on the Hero 7 Black and some reason do not see the HyperSmooth stabilization for 4K videos then head on to firmware update – there is a update waiting.,This HyperSmooth stabilization is awesome, you really do not need a external gimbal, well the output is even better than when you use a gimbal. Add to it the timewrap feature that makes use of the built in stabilization is another awesome feature.,Do check the samples shot in the video review below, the HyperSmooth stabilization is just outstanding, amazing, awesome. Hard to believe you get this kind of a quality in this small package.,Apart from this there is another interesting feature the TimeWrap, this is really good to shoot scenery, moving shots in fast motion. Battery life is decent, gives about 45 to 60 minutes of non-stop usage on a full charge.,Still shots also come out great, but since this is a action camera it is made for video shoot, that too in outdoor conditions.,Do note there is GoPro Hero 7 Silver and GoPro Hero 7 White comes with normal stabilization not HyperSmooth stabilization and TimeWrap is only for now available on the Hero 7 Black., "

The RealMe 2 first sale was on 4th September, and took some days for the delivery. Well here is the RealMe 2 review.,I bought the RealMe 2 Red color variant, I was deeply impressed by the RealMe 1 Red hence a logical choice.

You will fall in love with the design on the first look. The Red is as beautiful as it looked on the , same build and finishing and the glass on the back that creates a darker Red shade. The RealMe 2 I can say look way better than the RealMe 1, well same color / looks but on the back there is diamond cutting reflection that looks awesome, check the video review / images to get an idea.,Looks great, feels comfortable to hold and operate. You get a bigger screen area to work thanks to the Notch above. But that’s not it.

There are dual SIM slots and a micro SD card slot, you can use nano + micro SIM and a micro SD card all together.,Nokia 8110 4G is available in Yellow and black color options. It has got a curvy body, and hence also called the banana phone. This 8110 model comes with slider style option as seen in the first matrix movie, hence also called the Matrix phone.,The handset looks great on the first look, the slider completely hides the alphanumeric button. Screen is 2.4 inches curved display with QVGA resolution, handset body is made of plastic and weight is 117 grams.,There is 512MB RAM, 4GB ROM and micro SD card support. On the rear there is 2MP camera with LED flash, camera is not that great, but the LED flash can come handy – a torch light. There is Built in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Nokia 8110 4G comes with GPS option but that makes use of Wi-Fi and/or Network to get the location.,8110 4G is running KaiOS, this is not Android based. The performance is smooth, the best thing I liked is the slider functionality, especially when you get a call. Just slide to unveil the alphanumeric keypad and the handset will auto connect and then when you are done close the slider to disconnect the call.,Alphanumeric keys are a bit smaller in size, really difficult getting used to the 4 way navigation button. This is a feature phone at the most you can use it for making calls, receiving calls, SMS’s, checking emails on browser, you can also run Facebook, YouTube and twitter via the browser.,There is no Whatsapp. Handset supports 4G, and if need be you can use the Wi-Fi Hotspot to share the net connection with other devices.,Now on the box it is mentioned that the handset supports VoLTE. However reliance JIO SIM did not work, I was able to use the 4G for browsing but was not able to make / receive calls which means for some reason VoLTE is not working in India, the hardware Snapdragon 205 MSM8905 1.5GHz dual core supports VoLTE, may be a software update might fix the issue.,As mentioned this is a feature phone, and if you understand what a feature phone you will know what it is capable of and its limitations. There are few who hate smartphones and want something simple, there are others who may love the Nokia 8110 4G for its style. Your choice your decision.,Nokia 8110 4G is not officially available in India but you can find it listed on Amazon and ebay, for anywhere between Rs. 7000 to Rs. 8000, it is pricey though.

The 2 pack Mesh system is more than enough for most homes / offices with about 2000 sq ft area and the 3 pack best for anything over 2000 sq ft.,Inside the box you will get the Nova Mesh either 2 or 3 units, cube style and they all look the same. You will also get respective 2 or 3 adapters and a single Ethernet cable, user manual is also included.,Nova Mesh is really easy to setup, I used the 3 pack mesh. You can use any of the mesh as a primary unit, i.e. the one connected to your primary net source. Setup process is really simple, the first mesh needs to be connected to the net source, same process like you follow with other router.,The 2nd and the 3rd Mesh setup is piece of cake, all you need to do is plug in the power, that’s it. Within 1 to 2 minutes the 2nd and the 3rd Mesh units will automatically connect with the first source.,Each of these units have a DC in, reset button, LAN and a WAN/LAN port.  Also each of these come with built in WiFi (Comply with IEEE802.11v/r), 1200 Mbps and are dual band i.e. supports 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz bands. The antennas are built in. Body is made of plastic, very good build and finishing., ,As for encryption it supports  mixed WPA/WPA2-PSK(default) and firewall – Forbid UDP flood attack, Forbid TCP flood attack, Forbid ICMP flood attack. Other features are guest network access, firmware upgrade, parental control and it also supports ,.,Each of the units in the Tenda Nova MW3 (3 pack) are pretty light weight I guess around 100 grams. They are compact and looks great / blends well with the environment.,I am using a dual band Router and I get 2 bar out of 4 for 5GHz and 3 bar out of 4 for 2.4GHz, now  if I install just 1 MW3 unit I get the same results like my previous router. However if I connect the 2nd MW3 unit near to the place where I was not getting full signal, Voila! I get full signal. So put the 3 Mesh in different rooms and you get full signal everywhere (covers most of the area, even dead spots).,Now there are two options you can either go for a router and then invest in a , / extender or simply buy a Mesh system. The Mesh system is much better option as it is easy to setup and performance in general is way better than when compared with a repeater.,Best part is the Tenda Nova MW3 is so easy to setup, download the app and you can know which Mess is connected / working plus you can also setup the Wi-Fi name. The Mesh system uses the same Wi-Fi name irrespective of how many Mesh pack (units) you have connected.,MW3 supports up to 5 units, so if need be you can update the mesh depending on the area you need to cover. MW3 pack of 3 easily covers 3500 sq-ft area.,This is an excellent buy if you have Wi-Fi range related issues at your home of office. The price is also pretty affordable.,Tenda Nova MW3 3 pack price in India Rs. 10,000,

Tenda Nova MW3 2 pack price in India is Rs. 7,500,

Xiaomi Mi Band 3,"Xiaomi Mi Band 3 review – Improved fitness band, but no new features",,"Xiaomi has already launched the Mi Band 3 in China, and it is already available there. Here is the review of Xiaomi Mi Band 3 that I got from China, this fitness band is not yet officially available in India. So how is this new band compared to , check the review to know more. ,The box packing is compact and inside you will get the fitness tracker, band, user manual and charging cable. This Xiaomi Mi Band 3 works with Android and iOS platforms. Unique thing is that it is 5ATM water proof, you can even swim with this band.,Mi Band 3 makes use of Bluetooth 4.2, features a 0.78 inch OLED touch screen, houses a 110 mAh battery and the strap is made of TPU+TPE material. If you look at the design the screen is curvy, comes with integrated button and the screen comes a little out when the strap is attached – check video.,You will need to use the same Mi Fit app to connect. This Band 3 also shows notification (3 pages). You can also get app notification and call notification with caller details. This Xiaomi Mi Band 3 that I got is Chinese version and it will not auto update to English.,1. First pair the band with the Mi fit app, you may already have the app or you can install,
2. The firmware may get updated, see if the mi band 3 still shows Chinese if yes then follow next step.,
3. Uninstall the Mi Fit App,
4. Now download and install this ,
5. Run the just installed Mi Fit app and the band firmware will get update,
6. The Mi Band 3 will now be in English,
7. Now remove this Mi Fit app you just installed.,
8. Go to play store and download + install the Mi fit app from there,Band 3 touch response is very good and smooth. It does come with lock screen so you can avoid those accidental touches. There are 3 watch faces you can choose from. This band can keep track of your steps, calories burned, distance traveled and your sleep quality.,There is continuous heart rate sensor, it keeps checking your heart rate every 30 minutes that is default. You can set it to minimum 1 minute, but that will drain a lot of battery juice. With this 30 minutes heart rate setting and occasionally connected to phone via you can get up to 20 days of battery life. It takes up to 1 hour 30 minutes or so to get the band fully charged.,Another really good band that gives consistent  results and comes with a budget price tag. Though there are very few additions / feature but really nothing new that will force the Xiaomi Mi band 2 users to jump to the Xiaomi Mi Band 3.,

Epson L4160,"Epson L4160 review – Power efficient, Cost efficient, with integrated Ink Tank",,"Here is the Epson L4160 review. This is another Ink Tank printer by Epson, but this one comes with integrated Ink Tank. L4160 is compact, comes with LCD screen, you can print / copy / scan and there is also a SD card slot to directly print photos from the card. Is this printer worth it? let’s find out. ,With this Printer you will get 4 ink bottle (Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), user manual, warranty card, USB cable and power cord. The Epson L4160 is a compact printer and the unique thing is that it comes with integrated Tank Design.,The , came with the Ink tank that was a separate unit connected via pipes, the big issue with such design was that the Ink Tank part was separate and hence needed extra space, plus when there was a need to refill it was kind of messy / ink spills.,But on this Epson L4160 the tank is integrated, and is a part of the printer, overall a compact design, plus the ink tank cap is different and the nozzle really small. Refilling is so simple and almost spill proof.,This L4160 can scan – 1200 x 2400 dpi, can copy – you can take photocopies of documents / pictures and you can also print directly from your computer.  There are several connectivity options, you can either connect printer with USB cable or connect via Wi-Fi or use the direct Wi-Fi option to directly connect without a router.,Epson L4160 is power efficient (12W). This printer supports Bi-directional and Uni-directional printing, also supports border-less printing. As mentioned the printer is cost effective in the long run. Each ink bottle (black or color), each bottle will cost approx Rs. 400.,Cost per page for black print is 12 paisa and for color it is 20 paisa. One Black bottle will give you up to 7,500 prints and the Color bottles (all 3 combined) will give you up to 6,000 prints.  Print quality is very good, do check the video review.,Yes, definitely. However these printers are not that cheap and there is a good initial investment required. You can buy for home / office use, for long term use the printer cost will be quite affordable (ink cost).,Another biggest advantage of the Ink Tank printers is that the Ink does not dry up so easily, this means if you are not using the printer for weeks even months the ink will not dry. This was a big problem on those low cost ink-jet printers.,There are several Epson Ink tank printers available in the market. Makes sense to go with the latest model.,The Epson L4160 printer is available for Rs. 17,299 – "
Vivo X21,VIVO X21 review – cool in-display finger print technology,,"The VIVO X21 was launched in India and here is the full review. Also check the video to get a better idea. This handset is priced at Rs. 35,990 now it is a little more than OnePlus 6 so is it a better choice, watch the video or read on. ,The , and the built and finishing is pretty good, the unique thing about this handset is the in-display finger print sensor. The finger print sensor is beneath the display, all you need to do is place the finger on the display and handset will unlock. There is also face unlock and host of other features.,Now this finger print sensor is pretty accurate and fast, however it might take some time getting used to this new technology. You need to apply a small pressure on the screen when using finger print unlock.,Inside the hood the VIVO X21 is powered by Snapdragon 660 processor with Adreno 512 GPU, that is pretty fast and can play high end games with ease. The hardware also does not heat up much, pretty much under control , max battery temperature I encountered was 36 degrees.,Screen is 6.28 inches supporting 2280 x 1080 pixels resolution, now this is 19:9 aspect ratio and it comes come with the notch on the top. Screen quality and touch response is really good (10 point multi touch).,Dual VoLTE is supported and this handset comes with hybrid slot, there is 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM. Handset is running FuntouchOS based on Android 8.1.0. Overall performance was really smooth and lag free. I was able to play Asphalt 8 game in high quality mode with ease.,Coming to the camera there is 12MP (f/1.8) + 5MP (f/2.4) dual cameras on the back with LED flash support. Front camera can shoot in 12MP resolution, comes with f/2.0 aperture. Camera quality is excellent, does shoot really good photos in bokeh mode, night shot was also pretty impressive. Edge detection is good for the rear camera but front camera sometimes does not do the job properly, you can check in sample images below.,The 3200 mAh battery supports fast charging took me 1 hour 40 minutes to charge from 7% to 100%. On full charge you can get 6 to 9 hours of non-stop usage (moderate to heavy). This means you will get one to one and a half day of battery life with mixed usage.,Technically the OnePlus 6 is better, more powerful, but technologically the Vivo X21 is better – this depends if you love / crazy about new technology like the in-display finger print sensor.,VIVO does really well in offline segment and there OnePlus 6 will not be that easily available, but even if it is, the offline customers are really not interested which one is powerful, which one can shoot better (especially when the difference is minimal), they really don’t care about the hardware but this in-display finger print technology will definitely catch their attention.,VIVO X21 is available for Rs. 35,990 here is the link ,

Moto G6,"Moto G6 review – looks awesome and unique, packed with SD 450 chipset",,"The Moto G6 is mid premium smartphone priced from Rs. 13,999. This handset comes with 18:9 aspect ratio screen and powered by not so latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 octa core processor. However the handset looks a lot different, unique and awesome. ,What makes , different is the looks, the handset looks a lot different from the other handsets available in the market. The glass back gives a unique look and reflects light in different lighting conditions. What’s more even the sides blend well with the back and follow the same glossy shine.,Moto G6 comes with triple SIM slots you can use 2x nano SIM and a micro SD card all together. Dual VoLTE is not supported on this handset, only one SIM at a time can use VoLTE. Screen is 5.7 inches with 18:9 aspect ratio, supporting full HD+ resolution i.e. 2160 x 1080 pixels. This screen also comes with gorilla glass 3 protection.,The screen size and the handset body / design makes it a perfect handset for those who are looking for a smaller handset that fits in their palm easily and makes it easier to operate with one hand.  Do note that this handset is a bit slippery.,Coming to RAM and ROM there are two variants 3GB/32GB and 4GB/64GB. The one that I used for the review is the 4GB/64GB variant. Moto G6 is running Stock Android Oreo and packed with all the sensors that you will find on a premium handset – including Gyro and Magnetic.,On the back there is 12MP + 5MP dual cameras and a 16MP camera on the front. Rear camera can shoot in bokeh mode, whereas bokeh mode is missing on the front camera. Picture quality is excellent, quality is really good, night shots looked great, however the edge detection in dual camera mode is not that great check video review to know why.,Apart from this there are some cool features like the spot color option in the camera app, check video. Now this option allows user to select one color and then show only that color in the photo (that too live before it is captured) and the rest is in black and white – looks interesting and you can capture some really cool and unique shots, check samples below. Moto G6 also supports Google lens.,The finger print sensor is on the front and is fast and accurate, there is face unlock option too and that is also decently fast. Handset heat up is under control, max battery temperature I encountered was 38 degrees.,The 3000 mAh non-removable battery takes about 1 hour 30 minutes for a full charge using the fast charger provided and on a full charge you will get up to a day of battery life with mixed usage.,A good handset powerful, can play high end games with ease – I tried asphalt 8 in high quality mode check video review. Moto G6 looks great, feels great and has got that premium look and feel however the only thing that might keep the users away is the Snapdragon 450 chipset considering the price.,Moto G6 is available from price starting from Rs. 13,999. ,
